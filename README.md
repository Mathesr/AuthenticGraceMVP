# AuthenticGraceMVP
This is a Minimum Viable Product front-end webpage developed by Rose Mathes and Lea Whitney as an assignment in the Moms Can: Code Development Camp.

The assignment is to develop an MVP for a hypothetical clothing boutique called Authentic Grace. We were given information on the hypothetical client including what the client stated they wanted in a website during an interview as well as basic page requirements. 

The initial assignment was to develop a responsive homepage for Authentic Grace.
For this homepage the "Blog" link in the header, the "Contact Us" and "Location" links in the footer, as well as the social media buttons have been placed but left intentionally inactive as what they would link to in this hypothetical scenario does not exist. There is no blog, physical location, social media pages, or contact info for the Authentic Grace 'Client' used in this assignment. 

The information in the 'About Us' Section was written based on the information given to us in the project requirements and the interview the client. 

The 'customers' in the 'Customer Testimonials' section are also completely hypothetical. Lea Whitney used images found on Unsplash for the 'customers' and wrote the text content. 

The secondary assignment was to develop another 'shop' page for Authentic Grace with at least one item showcased with information required to make a hypothetical purchase. The main focus stated for this assignment was to successfully link two pages together rather than focus on a fully detailed shop page. 

All navigation links on the shop page are functional, but the purchase buttons are intentionally left inactive due to the fact that this is a hypothetical boutique. All images were sourced from unsplash, there is no stock for sale, and there is none of the security coding necessary for e-commerce.
